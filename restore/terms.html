The parties must keep the arbitration proceedings confidential and not disclose any information regarding the arbitration to any third party except as required by law.</li><li><span class="list_underline__Xoh_F">Inconsistencies:</span> If there is any inconsistency between any term of the LCIA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Use as a court would.</li><li><span class="list_underline__Xoh_F">Scope of Arbitration:</span> All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator(s) have the authority to provide any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including injunctive relief.

Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Website, Services and the WalletConnect Network, the Website, Services and the WalletConnect Network may experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Website, Services, the WalletConnect Network and your digital assets.</li><li><span class="list_underline__Xoh_F">Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography:</span> Cryptography advances over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Website, Services and the WalletConnect Network which could result in the theft or loss of digital assets. To the extent within its control and otherwise possible, the Foundation intends to update the protocol underlying the Services and the WalletConnect Network to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any security updates will be made in a timely or successful manner.</li><li><span class="list_underline__Xoh_F">Risk of Blockchain Network Attacks:</span> Any blockchain used for the Services and/or the WalletConnect Network may be susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to: double-spend attacks, reorganizations, majority mining power attacks, &quot;vampire&quot; attacks, &quot;selfish-mining&quot; attacks, and work race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Services, the WalletConnect Network, expected proper execution and sequencing of transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Known or novel mining attacks may be successful.</li><li><span class="list_underline__Xoh_F">Risks Associated with New and Evolving Laws:</span> The WalletConnect Network, and by extension the Website and Services, may be subject to a variety of international laws and regulations, including those with respect to financial or securities regulations, consumer privacy, data protection, consumer protection, content regulation, network neutrality, cyber security, data protection, intellectual property (including copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws), defamation, and others. Such laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting the WalletConnect Network could be enacted. As the Website, Services and WalletConnect Network evolve, we may be subject to new laws, and the application of existing laws to us might change. These laws and regulations are frequently costly to comply with and may divert a significant portion of the Foundation&#x27;s attention and resources or restrict the way the WalletConnect may operate. If we do not sufficiently comply with these applicable laws or regulations, we could receive negative publicity and be subject to significant liabilities which could adversely impact the Website, Services, and the WalletConnect Network and your digital assets. Additionally, organization that use WalletConnect Network may be subject to industry specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these parties fails to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, the WalletConnect Network and/or and your digital assets could be adversely impacted.</li><li><span class="list_underline__Xoh_F">Specific Risks Relating to Value and Function of your digital assets:</span> The utility benefits of using digital assets to access services provided by Node Operators can only materialise through user-driven adoption over time. Such adoption depends on a variety of factors, including the pace of user adoption, the organic community-driven expansion of the WalletConnect Network. As such, the extent of user adoption is entirely outside of our control and cannot be stated with any certainty. Any market value of your digital assets may fluctuate in response to competitive and market conditions affecting the general supply of and demand for user-requested services. These conditions are beyond our control. The value of your digital assets on the WalletConnect Network may be lower than the price or costs at which they were acquired or purchased. The utility of your digital assets , and any value associated with that utility, will depend on the ability of the WalletConnect Network to adequately facilitate user-requested services. Inadequate supply may result in such services taking more time, while inadequate demand may make it difficult to obtain services, both of which may discourage participation in the WalletConnect Network. No promises of future performance or value are or will be made with respect to your digital assets , including no promise of inherent value, no promise of continuing payments, and no guarantee that your digital assets will hold any particular value.</li><li><span class="list_underline__Xoh_F">Unanticipated Risks:</span> Blockchains, cryptographic digital assets and related software are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in these Terms, there are other risks associated with the Services, the WalletConnect Network and any digital assets used on the WalletConnect Network, including those that the Foundation cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in these Terms.</li></ol></li><li><span class="list_title__mHK3c">MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</span><ol><li><span class="list_underline__Xoh_F">Severability:</span> If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect.</li><li><span class="list_underline__Xoh_F">Entire Agreement:</span> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the WalletConnect Foundation regarding your use of the Website and supersede any prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter.</li><li><span class="list_underline__Xoh_F">Injunctive Relief:</span> You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to the Foundation for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and the Foundation is entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law.</li><li><span class="list_underline__Xoh_F">No Waiver:</span> Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other provision.</li><li><span class="list_underline__Xoh_F">Assignment:</span> You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent.
